# Roadmap to complete the Product based Interview for SDE-1

## Nearly ~ 500 problem needed to be sloved

## General 100 days plan

1. Programming revison for [1-3] days.
2. Ds&Algo: concepts+easy problem [4-60] days.
3. Problem solving: Different pattern question [60-90] days.
4. Advanced Data structure [90-95].
5. Misc Topics [95-100].

```
Note:
    1.  LLD/HLD are required for SDE 2 not SDE-1 but take an idea.
    2.  Choose only one language to program python/C++ with STL.
    3.  For finance choose C++.[DE Shaw]
