# FIND min diff
# You are given an array of size n
# you need to divide the array into 2 parts such taht the difference between their sum is minimum.
# s1 + s2 = sum
# abs(s1 - s2) = diff = min
# when diff is 0(minimum) i.e s1 = s2 i.e divided into 2 eaual sum subset.
# i.e s1 = s2 = sum/2 <- least minimum value at this sum.
# when not 0 that means one will be more and one will be less.
# when s1 <= s2 and s1 <= sum/2; maximum possible value s2 can take is sum/2;
# Now find s1 <= sum/2 as diff = sum-2s1 = s2-s1 = sum-s1 - s1, diff will always +ve.
# diff will be minimum when s1 is less than sum/2.
