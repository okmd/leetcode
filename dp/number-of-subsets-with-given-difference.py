# Given array and difference
# find no of ways to split in array into two parts such that differece is same as given difference.
# s1 - s2 = diff
# s1 - (sum-s1) = diff
# 2s1 = diff + sum
# s1 = (sum+diff)/2
# if sum s1 exists then it is possible to divide into two parts with given diff.

# Now problem is reduced to count subsets having sum s.
