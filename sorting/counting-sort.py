# counting sort is used when the numbers are in specific range.
# step 1: Find frequency.
# step 2: Find cumulative frequency.
# step 3: Start from either left or right in original array, value at index 'element' gives the 'position' or index in original sorted array.
# Time complexity: O(range + N)
# range = 0..9, N = numbers of elements.
