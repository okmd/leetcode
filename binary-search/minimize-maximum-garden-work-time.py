# You are given N garden and K workers N >= K.
# You have some constraints as
# - A garden can have only one worker.
# - A worker can work in adjacent garden only.
# Your goal is to minimize the maximum time to complete all the work of garden.

# Approach 1:
# divide the array into k parts and calcualte all the working time per worker and find max time.
# arrange those k-1 pipes into N-1 position to get all the possible division and find time.
# N*N*N....K time.
# finally get the min of all the maximum time.

# Approach 2:
# use binary search as low = max(times), high = sum(times), mid= is the time to check
# is is possible to divide the work such that work gets completed.
# if yes then it the maximum time, if it less than any previous time then it is minimum till now.
